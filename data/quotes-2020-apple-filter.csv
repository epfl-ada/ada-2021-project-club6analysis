2020-03-16-030623;In the course of this case, the Autorit√© untangled the very particular practices that had been implemented by Apple for the distribution of its products in France (excluding Iphones), such as iPad. First, Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete and prevent distributors from competing with each other, thereby sterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products. Secondly, so-called Premium distributors could not safely carry out promotions or lower prices, which led to an alignment of retail prices between Apple's integrated distributors and independent Premium distributors. Finally, Apple has abused the economic dependence of these Premium distributors on it, by subjecting them to unfair and unfavorable commercial conditions compared to its network of integrated distributors. Given the strong impact of these practices on competition in the distribution of Apple products via Apple premium resellers, the Autorit√© has imposed the highest penalty ever pronounced in a case (‚Ç¨ 1.24 billion). It is also the heaviest sanction imposed on an economic player, in this case Apple (‚Ç¨ 1.1 billion), whose extraordinary dimension has been duly taken into account. Finally, the Autorit√© considered that in this case Apple had committed an abuse of economic dependence on its premium retailers, a practice which the Autorit√© considers to be particularly serious.;Isabelle de Silva;2020-03-16 14:11:25;1

2020-03-16-053372;The Authority has deciphered, on the occasion of this case, the very specific practices that had been implemented by Apple for the distribution of its products in France (excluding iPhones), such as the iPad. First, Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete and prevent distributors from competing with each other, sterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products. Second, so-called Premium distributors could not safely promote or lower prices, which led to an alignment of retail prices between Apple's integrated distributors and independent Premium distributors. Finally, Apple has misused the economic dependence of these Premium distributors on them, subjecting them to unfair and unfavorable commercial conditions in relation to its network of integrated distributors. In view of the strong impact of these practices on competition in the distribution of Apple products via Apple premium resellers, the Authority imposes the highest penalty ever imposed in a case (1.24 billion euros). It is also the heaviest sanction imposed on an economic player, in this case Apple (1.1 billion euros), whose extraordinary dimension has been duly taken into account. Finally, the Authority found that, in this case, Apple had committed an abuse of economic dependence on its premium retailers, a practice which the Authority considers to be particularly serious.;Isabelle de Silva;2020-03-16 12:02:19;1

2020-01-07-036389;In this ruminative, endlessly clever book, Pulitzer Prize -- winner Hass (The Apple Trees at Olema) turns his eye toward nature, love, and even drone strikes, as, when chronicling a visit to a Las Vegas Air Force base for a protest, he juxtaposes the specter of commerce at a nearby casino with headlines detailing drone-related deaths in the Middle East. Though death may be the prevailing theme, these poems are far from dirges, as images of his Northern California environs shimmer with life: `you can almost hear the earth sigh / As it sucks up the rain.' Hass experiments with form, vacillating between long and short lines, stanzas and long unbroken blocks of verse. His language is lofty but accessible, as in `The Archaeology of Plenty,' a loose, associative riff about finding meaning in a callous and capricious world, in which the poet argues for poetry as a cure for existential dread: `reach into your heavy waking, / The metaphysical nausea that being in your life, / With its bearing and its strife, its stiffs, / Its stuff, seems to have produced in you, / Reduced you to, and make something with a pleasing, / Or teasing, ring to it.'

The show brought on a lot of young people following my castmates and me, and that felt like a huge responsibility, or something I wanted to make the most of... But this came to mind as I was chatting with my friend Ben Rauhala, who is very involved in the musical theater community. And I was just like, `Ben, is this possible? Is this something we could do?' And we sort of dreamed it up right then and there. And I made a call to Kurt Deutsch. He's with Warner Music now, but I knew him when he was with Ghostlight Records. And I just said, `Hey Kurt, this is sort of something I'm thinking about, do you think you would be willing to donate us the space?' And I didn't really understand much about the music industry or what all it would take to make this come to life. So, he was a huge resource, along with Ben, in bringing these winning songs to Spotify and Apple Music and stuff like that. That's how it got started.

Jobs went, a bit reluctantly. `Steve was actually quite friendly to me at the dinner,' Gates recalls, but he `wasn't particularly friendly' to the birthday guy. Gates was annoyed that the guy kept revealing information about the tablet PC he had developed at Microsoft. `He's our employee and he's revealing our intellectual property,' Gates recounted. Jobs was also annoyed, and it had just the consequence that Gates feared. As Jobs recalled: `The guy badgered me about how Microsoft was to to completely change the world with this tablet PC software and eliminate all notebook computers, and Apple out to license his Microsoft software. But he was doing the device all wrong. It had a stylus. As soon as you have a stylus, your dead. This dinner was like the tenth time he talked to me about it and I was so sick of it that I came home and said,' Fuck this, let's show him what a tablet can really be.' Jobs went into his office the next day, gathered his team, and said,' I want to make a tablet, and it can't have a keyboard or a stylus.

I break out once or twice a month, but I typically get huge cystic acne flare-ups that leave dark marks. My skin gets more and more clear with every use. I've tried mixing the mask with just water and just apple cider vinegar and found that I get a smoother consistency with ACV, so that has been my go-to. I literally use just ONE TEASPOON of clay mask with one teaspoon of ACV and that's enough to cover my whole face and neck in a nice, comfortable, thin layer. I leave the mask on for about 20 minutes -- it feels like it's strangling the crap out of my pores!!! -- and wash it off. My face turns super red afterward, but it goes away after about 15 minutes. My face LOOKS clean and FEELS fresh afterward. I have been using the mask twice a week alongside the Murad InvisiScar Resurfacing Treatment and some huge, dark marks I've had completely faded!! And, the mask helps dry out the cystic breakouts before they can cause too much trouble. Plus, I've got enough product to last possibly another six months because the jar is so huge.;None;2020-01-06 12:20:24;1

2020-01-14-017678;Finally I want to address an issue regarding the shooter's phones. The shooter possessed two Apple iPhones seen here on the posters. Within one day of the shooting, the FBI sought and received court authorization based on probable cause to search both phones in an effort to run down all leads and figure out with whom the shooter had been communicating. During the gun fight with the first responders, the shooter disengaged long enough to place one of his phones on the floor and shoot a single round into the device. It also appears that the other phone was damaged. Our experts at the FBI crime lab were able to fix both damaged phones so that they are operational. However both phones are engineered to make it virtually impossible to unlock without the password. It is very important for us to know with whom and about what the shooter was communicating before he died. We have asked Apple for their help in unlocking the shooter's phones. So far Apple has not given any substantive assistance. This situation perfectly illustrates why it is critical that the public be able to get access to digital evidence once it has obtained a court order based on probable cause.

2020-01-14-098051;We were devastated to learn of the tragic terrorist attack on members of the US armed services at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida on December 6th. We have the greatest respect for law enforcement and routinely work with police across the country on their investigations. When law enforcement requests our assistance, our teams work around the clock to provide them with the information we have. We reject the characterization that Apple has not provided substantive assistance in the Pensacola investigation. Our responses to their many requests since the attack have been timely, thorough and are ongoing. Within hours of the FBI's first request on December 6th, we produced a wide variety of information associated with the investigation. From December 7th through the 14th, we received six additional legal requests and in response provided information including iCloud backups, account information and transactional data for multiple accounts. We responded to each request promptly, often within hours, sharing information with FBI offices in Jacksonville, Pensacola and New York. The queries resulted in many gigabytes of information that we turned over to investigators. In every instance, we responded with all of the information that we had. The FBI only notified us on January 6th that they needed additional assistance -- a month after the attack occurred. Only then did we learn about the existence of a second iPhone associated with the investigation and the FBI's inability to access either iPhone. It was not until January 8th that we received a subpoena for information related to the second iPhone, which we responded to within hours. Early outreach is critical to accessing information and finding additional options. We are continuing to work with the FBI, and our engineering teams recently had a call to provide additional technical assistance. Apple has great respect for the Bureau's work, and we will work tirelessly to help them investigate this tragic attack on our nation. We have always maintained there is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys. Backdoors can also be exploited by those who threaten our national security and the data security of our customers. Today, law enforcement has access to more data than ever before in history, so Americans do not have to choose between weakening encryption and solving investigations.

It was also because it was easier to wash aprons than dresses and aprons used less material. But along with that, it served as a potholder for removing hot pans from the oven. It was wonderful for drying children's tears and on occasion was even used for cleaning out dirty ears. From the chicken coop, the apron was used for carrying eggs, fussy chicks, and sometimes half-hatched eggs to be finished in the warming stove. When company came, those aprons were ideal hiding places for shy kids. And when the weather was cold Grandmas wrapped it around her arms. Those big old aprons wiped many a perspiring brow when bent over the hot wood stove. Chips and kindling wood were brought into the kitchen in that apron. From the garden, it carried all sorts of vegetables. After the peas had been shelled, it carried out the hulls. In the fall, the apron was used to bring in apples that had fallen from the trees. When unexpected company drove up the road, it was surprising how much furniture that old apron could dust in a matter of seconds. When dinner was ready, Grandma walked out onto the porch, waved her apron and the men folk knew it was time to come in from the fields to dinner.

I am the one who feeds her, is raising her, who came out through the hard times with her and for her, taught her to be a great human being and everything about life. I am the Only Mother to my daughter. No one else will be called any kind of `mom' name in English, Arabic, not an `Umi' or anything else in other language by her. I will not let nobody bribe her and change her by using material things against me, iPhones and other things. She will be raised as a human being, who cares for humanity and stands by the right principles. I will go far and beyond for my child as I have always done. Nicole has never called another man `daddy' or any other name that means `father' . No man has ever tried to replace or act as a second `father' to her overstepping boundaries and making decisions on behalf of her real father.

2020-02-04-086914;The U.S. Justice Department has reached out to app developers as part of its investigation into Apple Inc, one of the four big tech companies being probed for alleged anti-competitive behavior, according one of the developers and another person familiar with the investigation. The chief executive of developer Mobicip, Suren Ramasubbu, told Reuters he was interviewed in November by a U.S. investigator who asked about the company's interactions with Apple. The app, which has nearly a million users worldwide, allows parents to control what their children see on their iPhones. Ramasubbu said the Mobicip app was temporarily removed from the iPhone app store last year for a failure to meet requirements imposed by Apple. Apple introduced its Screen Time app, which includes parental controls, in June 2018. At the start of 2019, Ramasubbu told Reuters, his company was contacted by Apple and warned that Mobicip's app violated the iPhone-maker's rules relating to technical elements that had previously been acceptable. The app was removed from the app store for about six months, during which time it was updated to be compliant with Apple rules, Ramasubbu said. It was reinstated in October 2019, but he estimates his company's business has shrunk by half. A source familiar with the Justice Department's investigation said a handful of app developers had been contacted in what is the first indication of what officials are pursuing involving Apple since the investigation was revealed in June.;None;2020-02-04 19:45:19;1

2020-01-29-047267;"In 2012, January 1st, I received some emails from Google saying my website contained malware and that they were somehow blocking access. This means I had gotten onto one of Google's blacklists. My website did contain some malware. It was pretty easy to get rid of, but it turns out it's hard to get off of a Google blacklist. That's a big problem. I started looking at Google just a little bit differently. I wondered, first of all, why they were notifying me about this rather than some government agency or some nonprofit organization? Why was a private company notifying me? In other words, who made Google sheriff of the internet? Second, I learned they had no customer service department, which seemed very strange, so if you have a problem with Google, then you have a problem because they don't help you solve the problem. I learned also that although you can get onto a blacklist in a split second, it can take weeks to get off a blacklist. There have been businesses that have gotten onto their blacklists and have gone out of business while they're trying to straighten out the problem. The thing that really caught my eye -- because I've been a programmer my whole life -- was I couldn't figure out how they were blocking access to my website, not just through their own products... Google.com, the search engine, or through Chrome, which is their browser, but through Safari, which is an Apple product, through Firefox, which is a browser run by Mozilla, a nonprofit organization. How was Google blocking access through so many different means? The point is I just started to get more curious about the company, and later in 2012, I happened to be looking at a growing literature, which was about the power of search rankings to impact sales. This was in the marketing field and it just was astonishing. In other words, if you could push yourself up one more notch in their search results, that could make the difference between success or failure for your company; it could mean a lot more income. It turns out that this initial research was saying that people really trust those higher ranked search results. I simply asked a question. I wondered whether, if people trust those higher rank search results, I could use search results to influence people's opinions, maybe even their votes.";None;2020-01-29 19:15:40;1
