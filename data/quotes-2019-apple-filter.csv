It is not the function of this Court to determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects be dealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approach the Court. The internal mechanism of such pricing would take care of the situation. On the perusal of documents, we had found that one cannot compare apples and oranges.

I think Karl had a more irreverent spirit than anyone I have ever met, and he was always the first one to embrace the future. I remember when the iPhone first came out and he was the first person I knew who had one! He always had an otherworldly way to keep his thumb on the pulse, unafraid to embrace the new, sharing his vision for the future and leading us there. His unparalleled work ethic, passion, dedication and love for his craft is a vital life lesson in and of itself.

2019-12-15-016697;I think my first pleasures of indulgence in the kitchen were with my grandmother when she would bake, like, the apple tarts and even the dumplings, which are the sweet version. She would pick the cherries off the garden, she'd make her own jam with the cherries and then she'd make the dough and then she just put these two sides together, create these dumplings and in an hour you'd have this beautiful indulging moment. So whenever I do eat sweets, I'll always think back to that. But it is a little bit of candy occasionally, or a chocolate bar. I don't know, I just feel like sometimes you need it, you need it to get back to feeling okay, I treated myself, I really worked for this and that's probably why I started Sugarpova in the first place.

2019-06-17-044941;It has taken years of work to get to this point. Three decades ago, Apple commissioned a group led by the computer scientist Alan Kay to create a video showing how in the future humans might interact with computers using spoken language. The video, known as' Knowledge Navigator,' featured an absent-minded professor who talked with a computing system to perform everyday tasks and academic research. The demonstration inspired a number of developers, including the artificial intelligence researchers Adam Cheyer and Tom Gruber, who began research on virtual assistants while they were still at SRI International, an independent research laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif.. In 2010, Apple acquired the start-up and then released its technology for the iPhone the following year. Since then, Siri has faced stiff competition. Last year, Amazon said it had 10,000 employees working on its Alexa service, many of them focusing on improving the ability to understand complex commands. The Stanford researchers argue that Alexa's approach, even with thousands of employees, will never be able to adequately deal with the complexity and variability of human language because it is incredibly labor-intensive and may not extend to more complex conversations. Dr. Gruber, who recently left Apple after heading advanced development there, remains skeptical of any near-term technical breakthrough that will make it possible for virtual assistants to have human-like understanding.

If we wish to use Apple's payment system to allow our customers to upgrade to our Premium service, we must pay that 30% tax.

2019-04-24-051511;The IDFA is simply one of several device identifiers. Even if Apple were to change the IDFA on a weekly basis it would be using another identifier to ensure the new IDFA is assigned to the right device. Moreover, changing the IDFA -- however frequently -- will not change the fact that apps collect information on device users independently of IDFAs. Early in the smartphone wars, Apple distinguished itself from competitors by running an airtight app store. Unlike Google, the company set strict standards that most applications find difficult to meet even today. The iPhone was never supposed to run third-party applications, and only after the persistent threat of jailbreaking, unlocking, and competitor sniping did Steve Jobs relent. While critics call out Apple for its closed platform, there is a logic to this approach: opening up technology to outside developers creates privacy and security risks for which users hold the device creator liable.

Again, I'm sitting here acting like we're going to post Nick 40 times. It ain't happening. But there's going to be times where we had an opportunity to throw it to him and we didn't. And then you show them on tape. `Why didn't you not give him the ball?' The other one is we drive in the middle and they collapse. `Why did you try to shoot that ball?' `I was in the tree and my bike and an apple hit me in the head.' `Oh, really? Do you see he's wide open?' Those kinds of things. But I'll be honest, at the end of the day it's compete now. Compete. And that doesn't mean foul and grab. That means compete. Battle on possessions. They make a basket, don't get cool. You shoot an airball, don't get cool now. No, you dig in. `I've got ta get this back. I just shot an airball.'

Earlier this season, some farmers fixed the price at the same level as the highest price last year. This caused a divergence between market prices and prices in production areas. Furthermore, this year the harvest was abundant. Supply exceeds demand. The first fresh apples began to enter the market in August. That is when the price began to fall. This development is clearly visible in the price changes for Huaniu apples. They cost around 3.7-3.8 yuan [ 0.53-0.54 USD ] per 0.5 kg at the start of this season, but that price dropped to only 0.6-0.7 yuan [ 0.09-0.10 USD ] per 0.5 kg by the end of the season.;Li Ying;2019-11-11 12:59:00;1

The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are way better looking in person, after you've held one in your hands, and used its weirdly aligned triple cameras (there is a reason why they're like that, which I'll get into soon). [... ] Apple's deep software paired with the camera hardware is what sets the iPhone 11 Pro cameras apart and makes zooming between the three cameras feel so smooth; there's none of the stuttering you see on Android phones when you toggle from one camera to the other. It's for this very reason that the three cameras on the back of the iPhone 11 Pros are aligned the way they are: for zooming straight out from the centre. On Android phones, where the three cameras are usually aligned in a row, you have to physically shift the phone to the left or to right to recompose a shot, and doing so feels less like zooming in and out and more like switching to separate cameras.

That he'd step back from the day to day but always be there as a sounding board. But there was no reason to believe that. I never should have thought it. The facts were all there.

2019-09-14-043864;The Lexus LX is, at this point, a pretty aged vehicle, but its Toyota Land Cruiser roots give it a ton of credibility for those who want a truly capable luxury SUV. The current LX, which debuted all the way back in 2007 when George W. Bush was president, is distinctly old school. Unlike most of its competitors, it rides on a separate frame and sports a solid rear axle like a real truck. It packs an old fashioned naturally aspirated 5.7 L V8 that debuted in 2006 under the hood of the Toyota Tundra pickup. The infotainment is very outdated and doesn't even include Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration. And while styling is subjective, it's not exactly pretty to this analyst's eyes. Toyota trucks have a very strong and loyal following due to their reputation for longevity and capability, and while the LX is sold under the Lexus brand, customers know full well that it's the legendary Toyota Land Cruiser under the skin. Still, Lexus can't afford to keep the LX in its current form forever. Luxury SUVs are all the rage and their popularity isn't likely to wane anytime soon, and the competition is formidable. Word on the street is that an all-new LX will debut in a couple of years, and while the current version isn't without its charms, its replacement can't come soon enough.;Michael Harley;2019-09-14 14:53:23;1

2019-02-20-078782;Qualcomm is seeking the ban in hopes of dealing Apple a blow before the two begin a major trial in mid-April in San Diego over Qualcomm's patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has sought to apply pressure to Apple with smaller legal challenges ahead of that trial and has won partial iPhone sales bans in China and Germany against Apple, forcing the iPhone maker to ship only phones with Qualcomm chips to some markets. Any possible ban on iPhone imports to the United States could be short-lived because Apple last week for the first time disclosed that it has found a software fix to avoid infringing on one of Qualcomm's patents. Apple asked regulators to give it as much as six months to prove that the fix works. Qualcomm brought a case against Apple at the U.S International Trade Commission in 2017 alleging that some iPhones violated Qualcomm patents to help smart phones run well without draining their batteries. Qualcomm asked for an import ban on some older iPhone models containing Intel Corp chips.;None;2019-02-20 12:31:25;1

2019-05-01-109014;This company is an earnings powerhouse, and I want to put that into perspective. We just usually gloss over that [ earnings per share ] number. They're going to earn more money over the next five years -- this is what we estimate -- compared to overall FANG combined, or call it equal amount. So this is underappreciated, I think, by investors, and an important part: GAAP earnings powerhouse. The second is I want to put a finer point on China. It did improve. Specifically, the iPhone was the pain point last quarter. We estimate that the iPhone -- this is not a reported number -- was down 40%, 4-0, in the December quarter, and it was likely down 28% in the March quarter, so that was kind of the magnitude of improvement. And the last is the significance of the buyback. [... ] This buyback... is a huge deal. And just to put it into perspective, if they make good on their promise -- we're going to be listening on the call for the timing on this -- to be net cash neutral, if they make good on that promise over the next five years, that theoretically should raise the stock price by about 25%. I won't go through the details and the math on that, but those are my three biggest takeaways. They're less about this quarter. If I had to add a fourth, which is an important one, it's this is probably the best play on 5G, and we're going to get tired of hearing about Apple and 5G, but stay tuned for more on that.;None;2019-05-01 15:31:01;1

We see the combination of a lower base model iPhone price and the dual camera system as likely to drive even more unit volume out of the higher priced Pro lineup. In terms of services we had expected TV + to be provided as a free trial with device purchases but we did not expect that trial to extend as long as a full year. This longer trial period equates to an even smaller likely earning contribution than the 0.4% we currently calculate in fiscal year 2020.

It was probably one of the simpler rooms where it was a computer-generated animation of waves crashing all around the room projected from the center of the room outward.

The open part (where the cord goes in) is bigger than I anticipated, so it can hold more than one cord. However, the lightning end of an iPhone cord stays in it, and the top part where you put the cords in is soft yet springy, so it's easy to get cords in and out.

When ion 1999 the old Otumfo passed on and the new Otumfo, our present one, was asked to come from Henley-on-Thames near London down to Ghana to sit on the Golden Stool, Thomas was working for Mercedes-Benz in their Bremen plant. As young man he had settled in Hamburg Wandsbek, was married with three children, later divorced. When in two thousand in Hanover the World Exhibition opened its gates, many security personal from all over Germany were called to assist at the one time venue. Someone in Chancellor Schr√∂der `s administration identified Thomas as potentially the next king of the Ashanti's. He asked an enjoy to meet with Thomas. Thomas was asked to come to the Police Headquarters in Hamburg at then Berliner Tor for discussion. He was made the offer Germany would help him to be pushed onto the Golden Stool with the help of the German Government. Thomas had declined the offer as it was against the tradition of his royal family. His uncle Otumfo Osei Tutu II was next in line and so it happened. Chancellor Schr√∂der knew in the days gone by there was, and still is, a need for a German, a man European Leaders can trust, to manage the migration crisis on their behalf and in their interest. Thomas instead became the Private Secretary to the Otumfo with residence in London before re-marrying a Ghanaian lady living in the Bronx of New York throwing away his German passport to be an American citizen working in the maintenance department of one of the Big Apple ¬¥ s huge hospitals.;None;2019-08-10 13:45:00;1

2019-02-21-080035;Qualcomm wants a 5% patent royalty (with a $400 cap for the royalty base) on smartphones. 3.25% of that relates to standard-essential patents, though I haven't seen Qualcomm successfully enforce even one of those SEPs in all those years. The related dollar amount will be illusory the moment its wireless SEPs must be licensed at the chipset level. Another 1.75% relates to non-standard-essential patents, and after almost two years of non-SEP infringement litigaton against Apple, Qualcomm has no real leverage. News cycles aren't leverage. So there's a problem with what they charge, but until I read this pretrial brief, I was unaware of there being another problem with the wide net they cast when actually collecting their royalties. Apple and its contract manufacturers complain that when Qualcomm performs audits, it insists on getting its 5% on whatever Apple pays to a company like Foxconn: not only the device, but also any services, including repairs. I'll use Foxconn as the example here because I've been able to find articles on its iPhone repair capacity. Quite often, devices are repaired right at an Apple Store (such as an iPhone 7 Plus I took there a few months ago to get a new screen and battery). In that case, Qualcomm probably can't charge patent royalties because it doesn't have a direct agreement with Apple. But some devices are sent to China to be repaired there at a lower cost. And in that case, Qualcomm collects 5% of whatever a company like Foxconn charges Apple.;Florian Mueller;2019-02-21 13:45:36;1

They've long existed in the South as a check on Klan violence, and they not only make it easier for police to immediately identify and arrest criminals, they also allow witnesses to preserve the pictures and videos of violent attackers for later criminal or civil action.... Anti-masking laws can be unconstitutional when applied to peaceful demonstrators seeking to protect their identities as a matter of personal safety, but that reasoning doesn't apply to Antifa. Its members seek to engage in violence and destruction with impunity, and the mask protects them from legal accountability....

For Goldman, a 150-year-old investment bank that counts corporations and the ultrawealthy as its clients, the move heightens the risks it faces launching a card during the latter stages of a decade-long U.S. expansion.

2019-10-28-059824;One regular client of mine was in Venice for the Biennale, and was traveling with around 20 friends and staying at a five-star hotel. While out sightseeing one day, her iPhone slipped from her fingers and landed in one of the canals. She was frantic, and the SOS came to me via her assistant back in Dallas. The assistant wanted to send a replacement iPhone via FedEx, but I told her that wouldn't work, as I knew there would be issues at customs. Instead, she had the phone delivered to me, and I jumped on a plane to Venice [ from the U.S. ] so I could deliver it personally. I walked into the trattoria where the group was eating, and personally handed her that new phone. Another client of mine -- a big investment banker who has many homes -- was worried about his daughter, who was anxious about being separated from her pet hamster during their family vacation. I made arrangements with an airline to secure two seats: one for the hamster, and one for a handler for the pet. They flew from New York to L.A., and the handler delivered the hamster right into the hands of the child. Everyone was very happy to be reunited.;Jim Strong;2019-10-28 21:15:13;1

As the head of Toyota was known to say, `Mistakes are precious.' Jobs learned from those mistakes and then made sure to surround himself with very skilled people who were willing to stand up to him. People like Jon Rubenstein (who led the iPod team), and the head of hardware, Avie Tevanian, and (chief design officer) Jony Ive. Those were people that had a kind of power and heft and talent and skill and experience to take that newly invented company to the promised land.

The only damage they show, and that occasionally, is a flaky spot caused by hail. Apples like that won't sell in the market, though they are good to eat and good for cider. At the mill, the apples are inspected carefully when they arrive, washed, inspected again and sent by conveyor to the hammer-mill and the press. Hammers crush the apples before they go to the press.

Socheata: Having gone through both good and bad times, I still love my acting career, which has brought my name to the world. But, we actors and actresses are still not receiving enough support. I know this is not Hollywood, but at least we need enough payment to live properly. I hope the government, particularly the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts, will do whatever it can to help the local productions compete against imported films while enhancing actors' living standards, for example by giving us health insurance. It is very embarrassing for Cambodian artists, whose job is not only to entertain but also to help people reflect on their society and history, to beg for help when they are sick, like many of them are doing today. I know this very clearly because I had been there already, although I did not beg for help from anyone.

A Samsung official told the Herald that `As part of improving efficiency in management of the China business, it is a natural step to reduce the workforce at the remaining production facility.

But it shut down one in Tianjin late last year due to falling profitability. The latest downsizing of the production workforce in Huizhou raises speculations that the company could close the remaining plant and pull out from the world's biggest phone market. The company took a 0.8 percent share of the Chinese smartphone market, shipping 3.4 million units in 2018, which dropped the Korean firm out of the top 10, according to data from Strategic Analytics.

Tensions are rising prior to the meeting between U.S. President Trump and China's President Xi at the G20 Osaka Summit starting next Friday June 28. The US and China were on the verge of a historic trade deal with China when they back-tracked from provisions protecting U.S. Intellectual Property into law. Protecting U.S. Intellectual Property is important to all U.S. companies in the long run, even though many U.S. companies are upset about possible new tariffs in the short run.

Luckily, I met EltaMD, which uses apple amino acids, a much milder cleanser than soap-based ones. After using for three weeks now, the first thing I noticed is that my skin doesn't feel dry anymore after I wash it. Moreover, what surprised me was the acne on my face started dispersing.

2019-09-29-037512;Tonight, at sunset, Jewish communities in Canada and around the world will celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. Rosh Hashana marks the start of the High Holidays, culminating in Yom Kippur. It is a time to reflect on the past year, and turn towards the future with hope. As family and friends dip apples in honey and share special meals together, we remember what matters most -- spending time with loved ones and working to build a better world. Just like today is a chance to celebrate the many contributions of Jewish Canadians, it is also a time to recommit to fighting antisemitism, hatred, and discrimination in all their forms. For many Jewish Canadians, this year has been a difficult one. Communities in Canada and beyond have suffered violent acts of hate -- acts that have no place in our country, or our world. We will always stand with the Jewish community, and stand united against hate -- and together, we will make our world a better one. Our diversity, compassion, and openness are Canada's strengths. Today, I encourage all Canadians to reflect on how we can bring those values to life every day. On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a joyful and peaceful New Year.

2019-02-18-052112;NEW YORK -- In the last few years, globalization has come under renewed attack. Some of the criticisms may be misplaced, but one is spot on: globalization has enabled large multinationals, like Apple, Google, and Starbucks, to avoid paying tax. Apple has become the poster child for corporate tax avoidance, with its legal claim that a few hundred people working in Ireland were the real source of its profits, and then striking a deal with that country's government that resulted in its paying a tax amounting to.005% of its profit. Apple, Google, Starbucks, and companies like them all claim to be socially responsible, but the first element of social responsibility should be paying your fair share of tax. If everyone avoided and evaded taxes like these companies, society could not function, much less make the public investments that led to the Internet, on which Apple and Google depend. For years, multinational corporations have encouraged a race to the bottom, telling each country that it must lower its taxes below that of its competitors. US President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cut culminated that race. A year later, we can see the results: the sugar high it brought to the US economy is quickly fading, leaving behind a mountain of debt (which increased by more than $1 trillion dollars last year).;Joseph E.

2019-11-21-107493;This Thanksgiving I'm pulling out a few new barrel-aged beers for pairing. Our Not Stirred: Negroni is inspired by the classic cocktail and has lots of bright, aromatic qualities that find affinity in the traditional Thanksgiving feast. We spiced the beer with juniper berries and citrus to amp up the gin barrel component, and bittered with a touch of gentian root for earthy complexity. And on the sweeter side, we balanced with some vanilla to give the sour and bitter components their match. I love a Negroni, well, anytime, but the lighter nature of the cocktail lends itself to a longer day of indulgence, and the beer is a nice stopping off point in between the harder stuff. When it's pie time, it's [ also ] time for Maple Barrel-aged Brigadeiro. This once-a-year beer deserves its place on the desert course by marrying huge, intense flavors of coffee, chocolate and maple syrup with warming barrel spice of cinnamon and vanilla. It maintains its decadence while managing a touch of restraint, at a fairly approachable 9.5% ABV.

2019-04-16-006119;"Apple Won Patents Today Covering the MacBook Pro's `Touch Bar' and their Next-Gen Scanning Depth Engine | Main April 16, 2019 Apple won 62 Patents today covering the use of Radionavigation for Swimmers using Apple Watch, Eco-Friendly Store Bags & more The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially published a series of 62 newly granted patents for Apple Inc. today. In this particular report we cover patents relating to radio-navigation used in an Apple Watch; Apple's eco-friendly paper bags for Apple Stores; and 3D lighting techniques. We wrap up this week's granted patent report with our traditional listing of the remaining granted patents that were issued to Apple today. Apple Watch: Radionavigation for Swimmers Apple applied for a patent in mid-December 2017 for an accurate radionavigation system for swimmers wearing an Apple Watch. You could review our original report here for an overview of Apple's invention that was granted to them today under number 10,261,192. Radionavigation techniques for swimmers consist of a radionavigation subsystem that is able to estimate position, velocity and time (PVT) for a swimmer when wearing an Apple Watch that is periodically submerged under water. Environmentally Friendly Apple Store Paper Bags Apple was granted design patents (01 & 02) for Apple Store bags. They were mocked for trying to patent a paper bag. Of course it wasn't just any paper bag, but rather one that was eco-friendly. Today Apple was granted patent 10,259,616 covering their invention of this eco-friendly bag made of at least 60% post-consumer content. Even the handle of the bag was reinvented as it is formed entirely of paper fiber yarn knitted in a circular-knit pattern.

2019-07-31-028340;I think it was a great quarter in this regard... Very quickly the company has grown away from the iPhone being super dominant in terms of total revenues. I thought the services numbers were just a tad weak. China was very encouraging, in terms of a slowdown in the sequential decline. And I think wearables is a bright spot for the ecosystem. So, in general, I think the little bits of bad news were offset by some powerful news in other segments.

The recently announced rights offering is an important vote of confidence from our shareholders -- backstopped by our largest shareholder -- that strengthens WildBrain's financial position and is a further step towards long-term sustainable growth. In the six months since taking on my advisory position and two months now as CEO, I've become more energized and enthused about the untapped opportunities across our portfolio of assets.

2019-05-13-093208;To evade the Court's test, all Apple must do is amend its contracts. Instead of collecting payments for apps sold in the App Store and remitting the balance (less its commission) to developers, Apple can simply specify that consumers' payments will flow the other way: directly to the developers, who will then remit commissions to Apple. No antitrust reason exists to treat these contractual arrangements differently, and doing so will only induce firms to abandon their preferred-and presumably more efficient-distribution arrangements in favor of less efficient ones.;Neil Gorsuch;2019-05-13 15:49:12;1

2019-11-13-081398;Since its launch in 2007, Apple's iPhone has been an unquestionable success, helping AAPL grow into one of the largest companies in the world by market cap. Given the ubiquitous nature of smartphones and consumer attachment to them (try entering a room or walk down the street without seeing multiple people staring into one's phone), we expect the smartphone market to remain resilient. Even without significant market growth, we view the iPhone brand, as it currently sits today, to be a cash-generating machine. Importantly, we view iPhone sales largely as recurring revenue. With high switching costs (transferring files, contacts, learning an operating system, etc.), we expect sticky customers that could, conceivably, be viewed as an annuity. Instead of viewing iPhone sales as discreet events, it may be best to view AAPL's 900 million iPhone users as $200 - $500/yr annual revenue with lumpy cash flows.;Robert Muller;2019-11-13 08:40:57;1

2019-05-28-090286;There are so many incredible moments. I would say one of the most special was the day that the First Lady (Michelle Obama) came into ride in the summer of 2014. We had the secret service come in, in advance. I have never gotten on a train so fast in all my life to make sure that everything was perfect -- we really couldn't believe it was happening. So that was really special and to watch her over the years that they were in office really become a part of our community because she said it was the place where she could come with her girls, not having anyone looking at them and let her hair down and dance - that's why we do what we do. It's to create those safe spaces for people. So if I can create that for the first lady of the United States of American -- it doesn't get much better than that! And I would say in the last year we announced last summer we launched our media division and they said that 86% of our riders tell us on a quarterly basis they want to spend more time with the brand and our instructors and the feeling they get when they meet the class so we built a media division to figure out how to take the 45 minutes and grab more of the 23 hours and 15 that we didn't have our writers with us so the first thing we did was to launch inspirational playlists with Apple Music and that was really exciting to see our instructors to go up on Apple Music home page and then we launched a concert series called Sound which brings artists who are riders typically and creates a live concert experiential activation. The most recent one we did was in Los Angeles. We had Ciara there on stage -- she performed for one of our master instructors a live set so it's like a concert, six bikes on the stage, 50 bikes on the floor like front row VIP, so people got to ride along to the music and then we had 500 people in the venue dancing along with this live, on bike performance and so those activations for us are a great way to get people interested in engaging with the brand who maybe wouldn't come to the studio so we will be bringing Sound to London in the fall.;None;2019-05-28 08:56:56;1

An acceptable one for the Nittany Lions, considering the two seasons previous. The 2000 season began with the USC Kickoff Classic disaster. Last year brought the Miami boil. The time was right for a once-proud program to make a statement. Penn State did. For about 15 minutes. The other 45 minutes? They weren't all that special.

2019-06-20-004048;Albert Liu, my colleague at the San Francisco Department of Public Health published in late 2013 evidence that PrEP... as a concept [ Diffusion of Innovation ], was being handed off from the innovators... The 2.5% of people who will try anything as long as its new and it has some promise... That those innovators were starting to pass the PrEP concept off to early adopters, who are characterized by people who... will use it but only if they're sure that it really works and it really works well. So early adopters are very interested in knowing how well PrEP works. They care a lot about whether it's 99% effective or 100% effective and there's endless debate online about whether PrEP is 99.5% protective or 99.8% protective. They care that it works and we know that from marketing as well. I mean, if you're marketing iPhones to early adopters and there's one little feature buried three tiers below that doesn't work the way it should, [ then ] you're going to hear about it because early adopters are characterized by people who really want it to work and for PrEP, that means it has to work really well when used and the good news is that it does.;Robert Grant;2019-06-20 23:35:25;1

2019-11-18-077549;The last line of defense for biographies this dreadful tends to be that, even if they get the details wrong, they stir interest in the main character. In the case of Dickinson, though, the blending of the fictional and the true is so thorough that it may continue to confuse students who want to understand a great national poet... Any fair look at the evidence we do have about Emily Dickinson's personal life suggests that she had the same sort of chronically unresolved internal conflicts that she had in her religious life. For all her feisty resistance to young men who courted her in her teens and twenties, she later encouraged romantic pursuit by a series of older -- and mostly literary -- men. In some of her surviving correspondence (her sister Lavinia destroyed most of it after Emily's death), more traditional aspects of her personality emerge, particularly in letters in which she submissively addresses an unknown man as `Master.' If one encounters viewers of Dickinson fired up to learn more about Emily Dickinson, you can be quick to dismiss Apple TV's Dickinson as a Hollywood fever dream. For those in search of the real Emily Dickinson, tell them the best place to start is Sewall's well-written and meticulous 1974 work, The Life of Emily Dickinson.;None;2019-11-18 11:59:19;1

2019-11-17-035820;"Perhaps the most remarkable findings in the Olympic level meditators has to do with what's called a ** gamma wave **. All of us get gamma for a ** very short period when we solve a problem we've been grappling with, even if it's something that's vexed us for months **. We get about half second of gamma; it's the strongest wave in the EEG spectrum. We get it when we bite into an apple or imagine biting into an apple, and for a brief period, a split-second, inputs from taste, sound, smell, vision, all of that come together in that imagined bite into the apple. But that lasts very short period in an ordinary EEG. What was stunning was that the Olympic level meditators, these are people who have done up to 62,000 lifetime hours of meditation, their brainwave shows gamma very strong all the time as a lasting trait just no matter what they're doing. It's not a state effect, it's not during their meditation alone, but it's just their every day state of mind. We actually have no idea what that means experientially. Science has never seen it before. We also find that in these Olympic level meditators when we asked them, for example, to do a meditation on compassion their level of gamma jumps 700 to 800 percent in a few seconds. This has also never been seen by science. So we have to assume that the special state of consciousness that you see in the highest level meditators is a lot like something described in the classical meditation literatures centuries ago, which is that there is a state of being which is not like our ordinary state. Sometimes it's called liberation, enlightenment, awake, whatever the word may be we suspect there's really no vocabulary that captures what that might be. The people that we've talked to in this Olympic level group say it's very spacious and you're wide open, you're prepared for whatever may come, we just don't know.

By growing double digits, Apple added 2 percentage points to its market share year-over-year. Apple is attempting to remake the computing market with more mobile iPad Pros for productivity while offering lower priced iPad slates for entertainment. The product mix tilted toward iPad Pro due to the launch of its newest products in that line and boosted ASPs to $463 this quarter from $445 in 2017. Meanwhile, Android shipments fell to 32.9 million units worldwide in Q4 2018, down 6% from 34.9 million a year earlier and up 35% sequentially. Market share fell 3 percentage points year-on-year to 60% as many branded Android vendors find it very difficult to compete on price in the wake of Apple lowering its iPad prices.

This year, however, because weather conditions delayed the production season and Frost Descend already started on the 25th of October, farmers estimate that they have harvested less than 50% of their top-quality apples.

We did a lot of the work in integration and security, the basics to have those at work. But as the iPad came out it became more apparent that the iPad seemed like a great business tool and there's a super cool SDK. So what started to happen then was a little bit more attention to corporate-liable [ or corporate-owned devices ] and to building custom apps for iPad but also for iPhone. And that was a little different because it would be, for example, for a field service organization that was going to be using the devices, and corporate-liable made sense that the hardware be purchased and the plans would be paid for by the company.

We join the government and our law enforcement agencies in condemning and working towards eradicating the menace of illegal drugs as a moral scourge, a threat to public health and the socio-economic stability of the Philippines. Since 2016, the FFCCCII has supported the government's efforts to rehabilitate drug users through the donations of rehabilitation centers in Candelaria, Lucban and Mulanay, Quezon Province; Tagbilaran, Bohol province; Island Garden City of Samal, Davao del Norte province; Mati, Davao Oriental province; and Surallah, South Cotabato province. We believe that a wholistic anti-illegal drug campaign should include rehabilitation of drug users. We wish to clarify certain media reports, which link Filipino Chinese to illegal drugs. We appeal to media and other sectors to refrain from generalizing that members of the Filipino Chinese community as peddlers of illegal drugs and inadvertently besmirching our community's reputation. As with any community, there may be a handful of wrongdoers or bad apples but the same should not affect the rest of the community. We want to reiterate that most, if not all of the ethnic Chinese community members in the country, are law-abiding Filipino citizens, legitimate business people and conscientious in upholding rule of law. Let us be more careful in making public statements that may unnecessarily create rancor, conflicts, misunderstanding and promote unfair stereotypes. In this light, the FFCCCII would like to revisit discussions on proposals by many citizens on the re-imposition of the death penalty for heinous crimes, particularly for drug traffickers and pushers. We may look at our Asian neighbors like Singapore, China and Taiwan on how capital punishment has deterred the commission of heinous crimes.

This will turn the advertising supported and privacy invasive economic model of the current internet on its head, making it possible for anyone to afford dedicated, private and secure resources to support a Prospero and Ariel-like world of certified and secure services.

2019-02-01-009905;Atop the portico of the Brooklyn Public Library's main branch, between bronze effigies of Hester Prynne and Meg from `Little Women,' there sits a once-celebrated cat, and beneath her, a cockroach. The cat is Mehitabel, and the cockroach is her friend Archy. Starting in 1916, these creations were featured in hundreds of humorous verses and short stories by Don Marquis for his weekly column in The New York Evening Sun. They were eventually collected in a 1927 book, ARCHY AND MEHITABEL, and reprinted many times over. Archy introduces himself by throwing his insect body on the keys of Marquis's typewriter (all lowercase, since he can't maneuver the shift key): `i was once a vers libre bard / but i died and my soul went into the body of a cockroach / it has given me a new outlook on life.' Archy survives on stale paste and apple peelings in the news office, and pines for the free-living Mehitabel (who once was Cleopatra). On their adventures, they rub antennas and whiskers with the likes of `will shakespeare,' and the medieval French scoundrel-poet Francois Villon (now a feral tom).

Jony will go down in history as probably the most influential designer the world has seen (or at least knows about), sitting alongside his own hero Dieter Rams in the pantheon of greats. Just talking about the fantastic products barely scratches the surface of influence; he embedded design into the deepest recesses of Apple culture. And that influence spread to the world -- with his rise at Apple, an appreciation and understanding of design spread through society itself. He changed everything for the better. Apple's next steps I have no fear for an Apple without Jony. That culture of creativity and innovation he helped to create is everywhere at Apple. As he consistently said, he built a fantastic team around him, and they all have the same curiosity, obsession with perfection, attention to detail and a desire for everything they do to be better. The wider question is more, will Apple continue to foster a design and innovation culture within the whole business or, as the naysayers have it, will it gradually leech away under commercial pressures? You don't change the culture of a business like Apple overnight, it would take many years to change the business for the worse.

2019-10-21-079687;The world's changed. Along with the world changes, music changes. The music has changed, the way you buy it, you listen to it, you can get it on your computer now. You can do more things on your iPhone and you don't have to leave home, to shop, to do anything. Back in the early days, there was only music, sport and fashion that people were interested in, therefore a lot of importance was given to music, therefore, people invested time in it. Nowadays, it's here today and gone tomorrow. It's all done on a computer. Buy it, delete it -- that's all it takes. Before you used to go down to record shops and go through all the covers and pull them out and go, `Oh yeah, I like that one!' Get excited and read it, then frame the artwork at home. That's all gone now. A lot of it has changed. As I said, from the way you listen to music to the way you buy it. It's tactile anymore. You don't touch it. It arrives on a computer and you play it. Which is a real shame because when you make an album like you did in the old days, it's the immediate tracks that get your attention, but it's giving time to the other tracks to embed themselves in you and suddenly they became more important than the initial tracks you went to. Because you get tired of that. People don't do that now. They just get the tracks that initially attracts them and don't go any further, which is a shame because it's not what music is all about.

2019-08-27-044561;"It's a different game. The mid-90's game was brutal... It was a much more physical game. So being able to score back then meant being able to deal with physicality. Now, there's so much more space because of five-out, five being able to shoot the ball, that you have the opportunity to score more. The 3-point shot is more prevalent, so I think Daryl is right in terms of absolute analytics, but the real question is if you put Michael Jordan in today's game he might struggle some, because he wasn't a pure 3-point shooter. Well, that's wrong, he wouldn't struggle. He would be incredible, but I don't know if he'd be as efficient. But knowing Michael, he'd figure out how to be a 45 percent 3-point shooter, and that would change the equation. So, let me rephrase. If you put Michael Jordan in today's game and he improved his 3-point shot like you know he could, then I say Michael Jordan would be the more gifted scorer in today's game because he's more multi-faceted. James Harden in today's game, analytically-driven with lots of space, is only shooting layups and 3-pointers. I think for today's game he has optimized his scoring. So comparing this era versus last era analytically, I think Daryl is right; Harden is the better scorer for today's game, but I don't think it's apples to apples.";Daryl Morey;2019-08-27 20:00:00;1

Now, it's time to eat the whole thing. State legislation needs to relax environmental regulations in targeted development areas and allow local governments to waive development fees without having to back fill the lost fee revenue with another source of funding that local governments simply don't have. Inland California requires even more aggressive incentives and support to build affordable housing close to transit -- lowering or removing regulatory barriers alone doesn't cut it. In Central Valley cities like Fresno, for example, it is nearly impossible to finance affordable housing close to transit. The real estate market is completely upside down and only works for green field development on the outskirts of town.

2019-07-01-042858;Ive has succeeded in getting products to market with single-minded care and attention to detail, which had not previously been seen in mass production. Before him, it was telling how little importance most brands gave to small product design details. A product's design was often needlessly compromised in the pursuit of the easiest product optimisation. You only have to look at their connectors, cables, power blocks, latches, indicator lights and switches before and after Ive's tenure to see his influence. It's a sign of how much he has succeeded that today his designs seem somehow less radical than they used to do. Competitors may no longer copy the visual design of his products, but they've wholeheartedly adopted his design philosophy and approach to how products are built. The latest Google Pixel smartphone, Nest thermostat, Microsoft Surface or Samsung Galaxy simply wouldn't be in the same league without the work of Jony Ive. Apple's next steps With Apple to be LoveFrom's first client it's clear they will benefit from his skills at least in the short term, but in the long term it will be a challenge to find a worthy successor to such an iconic designer, and indeed it may be a thankless task to try. Who remembers the name of the designer who succeeded Dieter Rams at Braun, Richard Sapper at IBM, Alec Issigonis at BMW or Kenneth Grange at Pentagram? The challenge for Apple and his eventual successor will be to work out whether it's even possible to break free of his legacy and to ensure they don't simply end up creating iterative pastiches of past products. As they have done before, they will need the courage to forget their darlings in order to create the next generation of great products.;None;2019-07-01 13:54:18;1

2019-09-11-007586;As a child, I would shoot with a Kodak 110 camera and then I later upgraded to a 35mm film camera (actually, it was my Dad's camera). Fast forward a good 30 + years and I find myself in Pennsylvania. To occupy my time, I start shooting photos with my iPhone (I really hadn't shot anything more than a point and shoot after I graduated high school). My brother saw the potential in my photography and loaned me a DSLR that he was no longer using. This is when I truly started to hone my skills and really focus on photography. I would take any and every opportunity to go out and take photographs. Some of my favourite subjects while living in PA was the Amish and their farms. In March of 2018 I moved back to Clinton, and although I truly missed the beauty of the Lancaster farmland, I came to realize that there was plenty of subject matter right here in New England, with Vermont being my most favourite destination. I enjoy getting lost and finding subjects to shoot that are off the beaten path. It's not uncommon for me to just drive for hours with no destination in mind, turning down side roads and exploring as much as possible. I have found some of the most interesting subjects to photograph on those roads less traveled. Late in 2018 I was finally able to hand my brother back his camera after investing in a camera of my own. More of my photography can be viewed at my website at tworavensphoto.com While my site is not set up with a store, if you find yourself interested in purchasing any of my photographs that are on display here or that are on my website, I do work with professional labs and can offer prints, canvas wraps (which is what the majority of my work on display here in the library are) and metal prints.;Brian Wilson;2019-09-11 04:00:00;1

2019-06-03-036217;I was incredibly shocked and disappointed to learn of the Toronto District School Board's efforts to purchase nearly 4000 I-Phone XS and XS Max phones. These $1500 phones are the most expensive on the market. The average Ontario resident can't afford to buy this phone, why should the TDSB spend millions of dollars on these top-of-the-line phones for their senior executives, when much cheaper options are available? What's most troubling is that the decision to spend millions of dollars on top-of-the-line iPhones took place at a time when we have asked our education partners - including the TDSB - to work with us to find savings and protect front line services. For nearly two months the TDSB has been fear-mongering, scaring parents and misleading the public by claiming teachers were going to lose their jobs, all the time knowing they were going to spend upwards of $5 million on top-of-the-line cell phones. Furthermore, it is deeply troubling that the procurement was only canceled late last week - after media learned of this outrageous request. The TDSB only took action once they knew they were caught. At least four previous audits and external reviews have identified procurement issues at the Toronto District School Board, and it appears no lessons were learned-what else are they hiding? How else are they wasting public funds? Our government is prepared to take action to restore public confidence in the TDSB's spending practices. As a first step, I am calling on the TDSB to immediately review all procurement activity and cancel any unnecessary spending that would take more money away from classrooms. The TDSB must satisfy the public, and our government, that this type of blatant mismanagement of tax dollars will come to an immediate end.;Lisa Thompson;2019-06-03 00:00:00;1
