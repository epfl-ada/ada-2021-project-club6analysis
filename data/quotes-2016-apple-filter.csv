There's not that much build-up on tour, but the Apple Music Festival gig will be different because we'll be at home.

2016-12-06-134217;When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.;Steve Jobs;2016-12-06 11:44:15;3

2016-08-05-011445;But he's [ Ek's ] right. One of the ways he was able to eviscerate a lot of the piracy was through the free tier. If you were a pirate, you could get a worm or a virus or be exposed to unusual things that would hurt your computer. His free tier gave people music in a very protected way. It is all math at the end of the day. The math is that after a certain amount of free, what goes through the funnel to premium... it's all math equations. The problem now is the relationship not of piracy to free but YouTube to the free tier. That is where Spotify and Apple are complaining all the time that they have to have a very broad and wide free tier in order to compete because of YouTube.;Lyor Cohen;2016-08-05 04:21:06;1

2016-08-30-104231;The royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U.S. should be taxed in the U.S.. But Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the U.S. by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland. Apple also negotiated a special tax rate for itself of less than 1% in Ireland. When Apple used those tax avoidance schemes, it is understandable that Europe would try to go after them. The IRS has failed to stake a claim for U.S. taxes on those revenues for a decade or more. It has been passive and so Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes.

2016-07-26-055195;In terms of AR and the Pokeman phenomenon, it's incredible what's happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of a developer being able to press a button and offer their product around the word. This certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of the pressure on their servers. [ Laughs. ] But I'm sure they will over time. It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great. We have been and continue to invest a lot in this, we are high on AR in the long run, we think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. So we're investing, and the number one thing is that our products work well with other developers' products, like Pokeman, and that's why you see so many iPhones in the wild out there chasing Pokemans. I know there are people who want to call [ AR ] a new computing platform and we'll see, I think there's a tendency in this industry to call everything new `the next computer platform.'

Strudel is a Middle European dessert that is very common in the Italian region of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia and on the peninsula of Istria, where I grew up. But strudel is loved everywhere, especially at our restaurant Becco, where it is served warm with vanilla sauce and cinnamon ice cream. I make many variations on the theme, sometimes by adding fresh cranberries and or squash to the apples.

2016-07-10-056998;Today Apple contractors assemble iPhones in seven factories -- six in China and one in Brazil. If the phones were assembled in the U.S. but Apple still sourced components globally, how much would that change the price of the device? According to IHS, a market analyst, the components of an iPhone 6s Plus, which sells for $749, cost about $230. An iPhone SE, Apple's newest model, sells for $399, and IHS estimates it contains $156 worth of components. Assembling those components into an iPhone costs about $4 in IHS's estimate and about $10 in the estimation of Jason Dedrick, a professor at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. Dedrick thinks that doing such work in the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost. That's partly because labor costs are higher in the U.S., but mostly it's because additional transportation and logistics expenses would arise from shipping parts, and not just the finished product, to the U.S.. This means that assuming all other costs stayed the same, the final price of an iPhone 6s Plus might rise by about 5 percent. What benefits would this bring to the U.S.? Apple says its suppliers employ more than 1.6 million workers. But final assembly of the phones accounts for a small fraction of that. So even if Apple could convince Foxconn or another supplier to assemble iPhones in the U.S. without cutting into its profits too badly, that alone probably wouldn't be as transformative as some surmise.;None;2016-07-10 14:42:14;1

In the second quarter of 2016, we achieved better-than-expected total revenue growth. We expect revenues to resume its sequential growth trends in the second half of 2016, primarily driven by steady and sustained revenue growth generated by our existing utility apps. Additionally, we further expanded our content-driven product portfolio to include news service, short video, live streaming and CAS ual gaming. Most notably, two of our content-driven products, News Republic and Live. me, demonstrated strong performance over the past quarter, particularly in the U.S. market. According to App Annie's July data, News Republic, our newly acquired global mobile news service operator with thousands of high-profile media partners worldwide, was ranked as one of the top 3 news & magazine apps in the U.S. on Google Play. Live. me, a live streaming app, was ranked as one of the top 5 social apps in the U.S. on Google Play in July and was ranked as one of the top 10 social networking apps in the U.S. on Apple App Store in early August. While we don't want to downplay the challenges we face in our transformation from a utility app based mobile company to a content-driven mobile company, our initial success proves that we are on the right track and is progressing according to plans. Going forward, we will continue to leverage our over 600 million mobile MAUs to support our content strategy, deliver more personalized and relevant content to our users, and build Cheetah into one of the world's leading mobile Internet companies.;Sheng Fu;2016-08-19 09:00:00;1

2016-07-27-091953;Overall, AAPL delivered better than expected results and guidance, driven by iPhone and Services. We continue to focus on Services, particularly Apps, as we think it is still underappreciated by investors. In fact, we believe that the Services line contributed approximately 28% of gross profits in the quarter. With App Store sales growth of 37% y/y (accelerating for the fourth consecutive quarter), the App Store is, and we suspect will remain, the fastest growing and highest margin AAPL business for the foreseeable future. Most notably, this is still largely driven by games. We expect that as app utility improves in other categories such as health care, fitness, enterprise, autos, home automation, education, etc..., AAPL will be a prime beneficiary. In other words, we, the company, and we expect investors, are becoming more aware of the fact that Services and apps matter for the stock. To put a fine point on this, we expect that the gross revenue of the Services business will hit approximately $50b next year and account for 25% of gross profits.;William Blair;2016-07-27 20:04:41;2

ISIS knows this, too. At the same time, there are legitimate worries about privacy, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors -- including terrorists -- can exploit. There may be no quick or magic fix. In the Apple case, the FBI may have found a work-around -- but there will be future cases, with different facts and different challenges. So the tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to protect our safety and our privacy.

2016-02-19-109894;"There are two issues here; one smaller and one larger. The smaller one is that law enforcement is asking Apple to hack their own phone; to write code that will essentially break it. It is analogous to law enforcement asking the Ford Motor Company to spend resources in order to put a permanent flaw in their latest truck engine. I don't think that has ever been done before. The larger issue is this. Apple, and other Silicon Valley companies, decided a while ago that they did not want to hold a key to any backdoor that law enforcement might want to leverage in the future; not for obvious terrorist cases like this but for all citizens. They didn't want to be the law enforcement enabler if and when law enforcement decided to skirt our privacy rights (see the first version of the Patriot Act). The data for these terrorists is not sitting in some database somewhere. It is sitting on the terrorist's phone. In order to get it, you have to hack the phone. For this larger issue, you have to ask yourself if you want to grant law enforcement the ability to hack into anybody's phone even if they have a warrant. And before you say yes too quickly, remember that once this flaw is installed, every bad guy on the planet will discover it and leverage it. The FBI, in my opinion, is leveraging our fear of terrorism to give them a back door; not for this terrorist case but for every case in the future.

In the second quarter of 2016, we achieved better-than-expected total revenue growth. We expect revenues to resume its sequential growth trends in the second half of 2016, primarily driven by steady and sustained revenue growth generated by our existing utility apps. Additionally, we further expanded our content-driven product portfolio to include news service, short video, live streaming and casual gaming. Most notably, two of our content-driven products, News Republic and Live. me, demonstrated strong performance over the past quarter, particularly in the U.S. market. According to App Annie's July data, News Republic, our newly acquired global mobile news service operator with thousands of high-profile media partners worldwide, was ranked as one of the top 3 news & magazine apps in the U.S. on Google Play. Live. me, a live streaming app, was ranked as one of the top 5 social apps in the U.S. on Google Play in July and was ranked as one of the top 10 social networking apps in the U.S. on Apple App Store in early August. While we don't want to downplay the challenges we face in our transformation from a utility app based mobile company to a content-driven mobile company, our initial success proves that we are on the right track and is progressing according to plans. Going forward, we will continue to leverage our over 600 million mobile MAUs to support our content strategy, deliver more personalized and relevant content to our users, and build Cheetah into one of the world's leading mobile Internet companies.;Sheng Fu;2016-08-19 05:00:00;2

2016-02-13-056792;New experiences like virtual reality, self-driving cars, robotics, smart cities and more are about to test networks like never before. These technologies will be immersive, pervasive and responsive to customers. 5G will help make them a reality. The timing of the news that Apple has assembled a top tier VR team would indicate that Apple is preparing to take advantage of the advancements that 5G networks will be bringing to market. It may also be something that Apple's `Titan' team may be working on around the clock. Another technology that will benefit from 5G networks is automatic speech recognition (ASR) that will be able to take Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa to a whole new level, according to Counterpoint, an independent market research firm. Counterpoint noted that Apple's acquisition and commercialization of Siri was catalytic in giving ASR a larger user base and more awareness. Google's Now, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa have benefited both from Siri's front running. ASR is primarily used to perform basic operations like device navigation, internet search, setting up a reminder etc. as a part of smartphone's utility tools. However, ASR integration into connected devices with cloud based infrastructure and seamless integration through 5G network will revive its real value. Integration of natural language processing capacity and predictive analytics will push ASR solutions from a simple assistant to something closer to an efficient consultant for the user. Up-coming ecosystems around wearables and artificial intelligent will drive the ASR usability in next few years to become one of the key user interface options of next generation devices. In the IoT space, speech recognition can be utilized in smart homes to control HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning), lighting, entertainment and other connected devices. In order to achieve this, the device interface will require development particularly in relation to microphone position and performance.

On the supply-side higher smartphone penetration, as well as competitive data plans offered by operators, including zero-rated and unlimited data plans, are removing consumers' concern for data overage when listening to music on the move.

The RF content growth is a secular story within which product cycles exist. As data speed and throughput grow, more and more sophisticated RF components required, especially the bump from 3g to 4g LTE. But after that there's carrier aggregation and 5g on the horizon.

2016-04-27-058595;iPhone customers remain extremely loyal, and we believe the extraordinary utility of the smartphone provides room for a superior product to extract excess profits well into the future. This suggests that Apple is likely to continue growing iPhone unit sales over several years, albeit modestly, with a relatively stable gross margin profile... Apple's weaker-than-expected FQ3 (June) revenue and gross-margin guidance largely reflects poor demand forecasts that the company made early in the iPhone 6s cycle. The company over-filled the channel with high-end iPhone 6s units, and is now taking corrective action to clear the channel in front of the iPhone 7 cycle. While this has a clear negative impact on near-term results, it is largely backward-looking, in our view. Further, it does not change our view that replacement volume is likely to grow strongly in the iPhone 7 cycle, which should drive overall iPhone unit growth through F2017. We expect renewed iPhone unit growth to drive commensurate profit growth in F2017 and improve sentiment around the stock.;Andy Hargreaves;2016-04-27 14:33:02;1

2016-04-27-008222;Apple suggested the channel inventory reduction would be at least $2.0-billion, which is approximately $1.3-billion greater than we had estimated. This accounts for roughly half of the gap between the high end of the company's revenue guidance of $43.0-billion and our FQ3 revenue estimate heading into the quarter of $45.7-billion. We believe Street estimates, which were above ours, anticipated iPhone demand levels that were simply too high. The remainder of the gap between Apple's guidance and our estimate appears to be spread relatively evenly between iPad, Mac and Apple Watch, with no particularly alarming trends in any of these categories... Additionally, we believe the planned channel inventory reduction almost fully accounts for the weaker-than expected gross-margin guidance. After adjusting units and iPhone product mix in our model, our gross-margin estimate was in line with the high end of Apple's guidance. This suggests the company is not anticipating a material degradation in margins at the product level and, importantly, also suggests that margins can rebound once channel inventory has been normalized.;Aaron Rakers;2016-04-27 14:52:27;1

2016-07-21-009076;Apple is reported to have spend $19 million on Drake and was rumoured to have bid up to $25 million for Harry Styles. If Styles had signed even if he had racked up the same number of streams as Drake on Spotify in 2015 (1.8 billion, the highest number of any artist) he would still only have generated gross revenue of $18 million and net revenue of revenue of around $14 million, leaving something like an $8 million loss for Apple when Apple Music's additional retailer margin is factored in. Apple would however have been able to make up the remainder on album sales, but he'd have needed to have shifted a good number. Adele's `25' , the biggest selling download album in the US in 2015 drove around $15 million in label revenue.

2016-08-31-025510;For those of you that have iPhones, apparently you can have everything turned off, but if you press the home button and hold it down, there's like this voice control feature that comes up. It's like a Siri-type thing, but I have Siri turned off, just in case Siri comes up. But voice control on an iPhone apparently supersedes anything, and like is the god of your iPhone, and when it comes up, it asks you what you wan na do. And when you're sitting there in a meeting, and it's in your pocket, and you're leaning against that button, and the voice control comes on, it'll just pick up anything. Well, the phone thought I said to FaceTime somebody in my address book, so it started FaceTiming somebody in my address book that I haven't talked to in maybe nine years. But once it starts FaceTiming, it's like impossible to silence. You actually have to like pull your phone out -- I've got an extra battery pack, so I have to take the battery apart and swipe to be able to turn it off.

2016-09-10-005319;Apple has done a fantastic job of making processors exciting, and the new A10 Fusion was actually very interesting to the more technical among us. Where previously we had basic dual-core chips, Apple is now using a design very similar to ARM's big. LITTLE technique to produce a smart quad-core processor. Low-priority tasks will get shoved off to the two low-power cores while important functions will be kept on the high-performance main cores. As a result, you have a chip that's 40% more powerful than last year's A9 and without compromising battery life -- Apple has clearly learned from its mistakes with the previous two generations, where battery life was middling at best.

As CEO, he gets high marks for managing the company's growth, keeping margins high and expanding further into markets such as China (Apple had four retail stores in China five years ago. Today it has 41.) He has pushed into the enterprise market, grown Apple's product lineup and positioned Apple to make more money off the devices it's already sold: Its services business, which includes things like iTunes, iCloud and a mobile payments service, is projected to be the size of a Fortune 100 business next year -- all on its own. Apple remains the most valuable and most profitable company in the S&P 500 index. Yet as the company deals with declining sales in its major device categories and in markets like China, critics and some investors have fretted about Apple's innovation mojo under Cook. The first all-new device during his tenure, the Apple Watch, is not yet a mega hit. The iPhone juggernaut faces a saturated smartphone market, growing competition from low-cost start-ups and longer upgrade windows from consumers.

2016-09-14-078124;Maintaining a clean, accurate Organizational Unit (OU) structure is one of the fundamentals of running a Google Apps domain.

So in your OU structure, split off your faculty from your students. For example, certain schools have policies where they just don't want students using their personal phones. They don't want that Google Apps account tied to an iPhone or to an Android. So, they turn off mobile device syncing for students, but leave it on for faculty. There are different ways that you can do your Org Unit structure. If it's a single location, do it by graduating year.

Before you go nuts with the jalape & ntilde; os, taste the wine. If the wine is a touch on the sweet side add a touch more chilies. The heat from the peppers will be tempered by the kiss of sugar in your wine, making the wine taste less sweet. If the wine is dry and tart, lay off the heat and let the acidity of the wine act to cleanse the palate while the wine's limey flavor will play off the citrus in the dish.

Every once in a while a legitimate-looking article will pop up saying a big-name celebrity has died is some sort of bizarre or tragic accident. Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son, is the latest target. An article has started popping up on Facebook claiming that Smith committed suicide in late July. The headline sites legitimate sources like CNN, but when you click in, an ad pops up and leads you to a super sketchy site. TOTAL FLOP: `Suicide Squad' critics not sure how to feel about the film This isn't the first time Smith has been the target of a death hoax.

2016-08-26-001588;A future iPhone will include technology called FeliCa, a mobile tap-to-pay standard in Japan developed by Sony Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. The FeliCa chip will let customers in Japan store their public bus and train passes on their iPhones. Users would then be able to tap their phones against the entrance scanners instead of using physical cards. While the FeliCa chip is the standard technology underlying the service, there are several different providers of transit payment cards based on the type of transit and areas within Japan. The Near Field Communication technology powering Apple's mobile-payments service, Apple Pay, is prevalent in North America, Europe and Australia, but the FeliCa standard dominates Japan with a penetration of 1.9 million payment terminals, according to the Bank of Japan. The terminals handled 4.6 trillion yen ($46 billion) in transactions in 2015. Last year, there were 1.3 million NFC terminals in the U.S. and 320,000 in the U.K., according to research from Let's Talk Payments and the U.K. Cards Association. Apple has planned to launch these new features with the next iPhone models, which the company is set to unveil in September, according to people familiar with the matter. However, the company could hold back the transit card feature to next year's model if discussions with the Japan-based payment networks fall apart, one person said.

Lastly, service revenue grew an impressive 19% year-over-year, to 14.1% of sales. We expect healthy double-digit year-over-year growth in services (we project 19.1% and 18.0% growth for fiscal 2016 and 2017, respectively).

2016-04-30-009865;"despite the pause in our growth our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world and difficult year over year comparisons. We saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year our revenue in constant currency up 1% year over year. Despite challenges there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continues to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new to Mac customers and we generated very strong growth from services. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter consistant with the range of our own expectations but lower than the exceptional year ago quarter when we saw acceleration in iPhone upgrades and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: Customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models; customers who switch from Android and other operating systems; and customers who purchase a smartphone for the first time. As we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. First: from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5S cycle two years ago but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate we saw with iPhone 6 which is as you know is a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of U.S. smartphone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smartphone. Second: We continue to see a very high level of customer switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever. Third: With only 42% smartphone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first time smartphone buyers each quarter especially from emerging markets. For example: In India, our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago.";Tim Cook;2016-04-30 23:24:15;1

2016-02-19-116598;This court order demanding that Apple custom-build malware to undermine its own product's security features, and then digitally sign that software so the iPhone will trust it as coming from Apple, doesn't just set us down a slippery slope -- it drops us off a cliff. This case isn't about about just one backdoor into just one iPhone. If Apple builds this backdoor software, our government -- and less savory governments around the world -- will demand to use this new software every time they encounter an encrypted iPhone. But this isn't just about iPhones, either: if a court can legally compel Apple to build this backdoor, then it also likely could also compel any other software provider to do the same, including compelling the secret installation of surveillance software via automatic updates to your phone or laptop. Such a broad precedent would spell digital disaster for the trustworthiness of any and every computer and mobile device. The FBI has already spent the last year arguing for backdoors in front of Congress and at the White House, and now that's it's come up empty it's trying to get a lower court judge to convert a vague, centuries-old catch-all statute into a powerful government hacking statute. That's not how we make policy in this country, and Apple is right to fight this -- a loss would not only undermine its product but its entire industry and the security of every user of digital technology. A line must be drawn here, and we at OTI are eager to continue to fight to ensure that we can continue to trust the security and integrity of the devices we use every day.;Kevin Bankston;2016-02-19 14:00:00;1

She appeared in several productions by The Phoenix Theater and Manhattan Theatre Club.

2016-05-03-006900;Apple CEO Tim Cook still sees great potential in the Chinese market despite a drop in its revenue from the country in the first quarter. In an interview with Jim Cramer of CNBC's Mad Money program, Cook said Monday that the middle class in China is expected to boom from 50 million people five years ago to almost 500 million in the next five years. `This is an unprecedented growth of the middle class,' said Cook, adding that he `could not be more optimistic about China.' In an answer to a question from Cramer, Cook said he made a mistake by not mentioning the figures about the burgeoning Chinese middle class during the company's recent earnings call. Apple reported last month that the number of smartphones it sold worldwide fell by 16 percent to 51.2 million units in its fiscal second quarter ended March 26. The company saw a 26 percent year-on-year decline in revenue from greater China, its second largest market. The revenue drop in mainland China was less, at 11 percent. The company's overall revenue and profit for the quarter also fell from the same period last year. But Cook's message on CNBC was that Apple was still doing fine, despite some investors and analysts expressing reservations about the outlook for the company.;Tim Cook;2016-05-03 14:15:00;1

2016-08-22-082595;The change came into stark relief this month during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Thirteen days in, NBC's average prime-time audience of 26.7 million viewers was incredibly high -- more than triple the combined number of people watching ABC, CBS and Fox at that time. But it fell short of the network's hopes. Some of that slip could be attributed to viewers dispersing to NBC's live streams online or to its cable channels like MSNBC and Bravo, which were also showing the Olympics. The network said live streaming accounted for 225,000 to 500,000 viewers a night. About 75 percent of the $1.2 billion in advertising NBC sold before the Rio Games was targeted at prime time, while almost 10 percent went to streaming. Live streaming, whether through a web browser or the NBC Sports app, requires a cable subscription, and an ad plays before every stream. Only advertisers who bought television ads could buy digital ads, either video or display, and fewer brands were present there. The number of commercial breaks viewers of NBC's live streams experienced was similar to those on television, but different ads were shown on the live feeds of a wide variety of sports, like badminton and archery. Brands could choose to show either 15-or 30-second spots.... As streaming becomes a bigger part of live events, questions loom around not just how to make ads that work on different platforms and devices, but also how to measure their effectiveness. For example, what is the value of a broadcast view versus a streamed view? `You'll see considerable analysis from NBC and sponsors and people like us trying to understand the true net impact between the two' said Doug Rozen, chief digital and innovation officer at the agency OMD. Dick's Sporting Goods, a first-time advertiser at the Olympics, said it ran the same commercials on NBC's live streams as it did on cable and broadcast. The retailer has been pleased with the television ratings and the jump in streaming, said Ryan Eckel, vice president for brand marketing at Dick's. `We're trying to look at it as video, and not think about whether it comes through cable or internet or a linear broadcast,' Mr. Eckel said. `I know I'm just as likely to watch the Games on the app on my Apple TV as I am on the linear broadcast.' He expects networks to eventually treat streaming and television views similarly for big live events, especially as more advertisers vie for digital space.;None;2016-08-22 08:53:40;1

2016-12-20-065074;"Outside of Sky's AdSmart -- capable of showing different households watching the same programme a different selection of tailored advertising -- it's unlikely that linear TV will see much progress in all things programmatic next year. Channel Four is experimenting with interactive TV ads on linear TV via Roku streaming devices, but this seems like an experiment born from success in VOD. An area where the impact of audience data is really starting to make its mark. VOD user numbers continue to grow and, with advertisers being evermore intelligent about where and how they source their data, there's a phenomenal range of insight to enable them to finally show the right message, at the right time, to the right people, on their biggest screen, in 2017. Some of the most interesting moves in programmatic are coming from new media players rather than traditional media. This year in the US, Facebook have made their first move into using their Audience Network ad network to deliver ads to `over the top' video apps, such as Roku and Apple TV. Using your IP address, this technology can tell that the Apple TV in your basement is used by the same person or family that logs into Facebook accounts at the same place, and will use that data to deliver relevant ads. This technology is still nascent in the US; but by the end of the year it could easily be something that Facebook is rolling out globally.";None;2016-12-20 13:00:22;1

The best beancounter on the planet has no one to put him in check, and despite having the best software and hardware engineers in the world, they are powerless against Ive, Phil and Eddy.

2016-02-13-040187;In 2012, I watched grim-faced Christmas shoppers buying up as if the world was about to end, and made a new year's resolution: I would go for a year not buying anything -- not even second-hand. My first attempt failed, I was too negative, but I tried again, this time focusing on the money I'd save, the experiences I'd be able to afford as a result and how sharing and swapping could be fun. I was so successful I'm doing it again this year. One thing that surprised me was how much stuff I already had but never used. I travelled a lot for work and had hoarded so much hotel soap and mini tubes of toothpaste, I saved nearly $200 there alone. I swapped books and clothes with friends, and I embraced sharing. As Sydney author Rachel Botsman says in her book, What's Mine Is Yours, `We don't need to own a drill, we just want a hole in the wall' . When I was asked to bring an apple crumble to a dinner party, for instance, and didn't have a tin big enough to bake it in, I went to the coffee shop downstairs to borrow one. `Choose whatever you want,' the owner smiled. `Just bring it back when you've finished.' Not everyone was so encouraging. One workmate accused me of wrecking the economy.

2016-05-12-084800;"On Tuesday evening I was notified by my attorney, Michael Pike, that he had a conference call with the team leader at Apple, Inc. who informed him that, unfortunately, Austin's iPhone could not be restored to working order. They also told him that the phone is currently in several pieces, since testing required them to disassemble it in order to run the diagnostics, clean and restore components and perform a chemical workup. Although they were unable to restore the phone to a functional state, I want to thank Apple, Inc. for their hard work and generous assistance. If the FBI turned to Apple when they needed help, I see no reason to doubt that every possible means was employed to get Austin's phone working again. It's our understanding that Apple had a team assigned to the iPhone around the clock, and for that we are truly grateful. Needless to say, we were disappointed, having hoped to get some information or maybe just some final memories from Austin's phone. But the fact that it can no longer function as a phone doesn't diminish its value as a cherished memory of my beloved son. It's a small piece of him; something he used to call me at night when he needed to talk to someone, something he put his stickers on and carried with him every day. As any parent would understand, to me, it's not a broken phone, but a memory of my son that I will hold close to my heart and treasure for the rest of my life.

A sell on a position is the last thing they want to hear, unless they are short already.

2016-09-12-016888;Dear World, I feel it's only appropriate at this time to publicly retract a statement I made about Apple's latest mobile device, the iPhone 7, being the work of God. While it's now obvious that my remarks upset millions of religious people around the world and especially those who believe in intelligent design, it is apparent to me now that the new iPhone is, at best, a slight improvement on previous models and not perhaps the work of divine creation I suggested it was. While I believe it is a wonderful device, one I will certainly buy myself, I must concede that the lack of a proper headphone socket is not perhaps to everyone's liking and many people will lose their Airpods, forcing them to either buy another (expensive) set or a headphone adapter (also expensive) that, when used, will prevent owners from charging their phone while listening to music. Had Apple done what Nokia did in 2012 and built wireless charging into the new iPhone then perhaps I'd still have cause to laud the latest model with the praise I did, but they did not. I am certain there's a very good reason for having two rear 12 megapixel cameras, a wide angle and a telephoto, instead of one 20 megapixel camera like other premium phones have, too. On reflection, I've come to realise the iPhone 7 is merely an incremental update rather than a work of God-like genius and I therefore take back the remarks I made and apologise to anyone I may have offended. To my fellow Apple cultists, know that I still fully endorse the iPhone 7, even if it's not the huge leap we've all been expecting to see since 2011. Here's to at least 8 hours of use without the need to re-charge it. Thank you, Charles Stevejobs.;Charles Thompson;2016-09-12 03:35:42;1

Ross also notes that WiOS 9.3.5 is already available, meaning the population of iOS users, using devices able to run iOS 9, are already able to obtain a fix, including devices as old as the iPhone 4s, released in 2011. He adds that as iOS 10, with additional hardening, is to be released in the next few weeks, it is expected to achieve rapid adoption numbers. Between iOS 9.3.5, protecting devices now, and protecting a few models unable to obtain iOS 10 when it is released, and iOS 10, the overall amount of vulnerable devices should drop drastically in the next weeks and months. Travis Smith, senior security research engineer at Tripwire agrees, telling SC in an email: The typical iOS users will not differentiate between a major update and a security update.

Find clever and succinct ways to tell the stories of the misfits that make up each bottle of juice. Tell us how many `misfit' apples or carrot sticks we're drinking that would otherwise have been thrown away, and quantify the impact of that purchase. For example, if someone drank one Misfit juice every day for a year, what's the weight of the produce they've diverted from landfills? How much have they reduced their individual carbon footprint by choosing Misfit? Find tangible, bite-size ways for your consumers to feel good about themselves with each purchase.

2016-07-27-027801;From our point of view, there were three key conclusions. First, despite the introduction of the iPhone SE to the mix and the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, gross margin held up well (down 140 basis points sequentially, to 38.0%, but at the high end of management's guidance for the quarter). In addition, in our opinion, fiscal fourth-quarter gross margin guidance was relatively strong considering the effects of foreign currency (margins have been negatively affected by foreign currency by approximately 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis). Going forward, we believe the company will sustain its gross margins, largely because of its control on the cost and bill of materials front. Second, while ASPs declined substantially (down $47, or 7% sequentially) due to channel inventory reduction of over 4 million high-end units and the launch of the iPhone SE, gross margins were not materially affected, and we expect sequential improvement in ASPs in the fiscal fourth quarter. Lastly, service revenue grew an impressive 19% year-over-year, to 14.1% of sales. We expect healthy double-digit year-over-year growth in services (we project 19.1% and 18.0% growth for fiscal 2016 and 2017, respectively). In addition, we expect this segment to contribute 11.0% and 12.4% of sales in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and could reach 13.2% of sales for the full year by fiscal 2018.;None;2016-07-27 20:04:41;2

2016-09-10-005320;Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly. Apple employees were told that the layoffs were part of a `reboot' of the car project, the people briefed on it said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple started looking seriously into building an electric car about two years ago. It expanded the project quickly, poaching experts in battery technology and so-called machine vision, as well as veterans from the automobile industry. The team also pulled in staff members from other divisions across Apple, growing to more than 1,000 employees in about 18 months. But as the project grew rapidly, it encountered a number of problems, and people working on it struggled to explain what Apple could bring to a self-driving car that other companies could not, according to the people briefed on the project. Apple has also made some headway in the space. The company has a number of fully autonomous vehicles in the middle of testing, using limited operating routes in a closed environment, according to people briefed on the company's plans.

Apple Music announced the show on Twitter with a bizarre clip that features Blige singing directly at the Democratic presidential candidate. Blige covers race, police brutality, and identity in America during her impromptu singsong: weighty and worthy topics, to be sure, but the effect is mightily awkward, primarily because it's an interview setup and Blige is just a few feet away from the Clinton. To her credit, Clinton stays stoic in the face of overwhelming weirdness, but Blige has the better idea, keeping her eyes shut as she serenades her target from a chair.;None;2016-09-27 11:23:35;1

But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone. Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession. The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor.

Profitability declined as well, with gross margins at 39.4% vs. 40.8% last year. There was a big drop in iPhone shipments to 51.2 million vs. 61.2 million last year -- the first ever year-over-year drop -- as well as weak iPad (10.3 million vs. 12.6 million) and Mac (4.0 million vs. 4.6 million) shipments. China revenue, a recent point of concern, was weak as well at $12.5 billion vs. $16.8 billion last year and $18.4 billion last quarter. Hype was building for the upcoming release of the iPhone 7 later this year, but with reports of only a modest update retaining the same form factor (removal of headphone jack, adding a second speaker, better camera, and bigger battery) ahead of a possible all-glass iPhone 8 next year, much of that has been deflated.

In the meantime Apple is not willing to pay a dime. They're making profit, and they should share the responsibility for our city, but they won't. They abuse us.' It's doubly upsetting for activists in Silicon Valley, who say that Apple and Google's tax arrangements conflict with the way they present themselves as companies that are doing good. `They all have these mission statements with an overarching social component, a kind of give back aspect to their corporate image, `said Stephen Boardman of the United Service Workers West, the union that represents 40,000 service workers across California and has worked to unionize Apple's security team. `They aren't held accountable to it.'

2016-10-17-001537;"With Give and Take, Adam Grant not only introduced a landmark new paradigm for success but also established himself as one of his generation's most compelling and provocative thought leaders. In Originals he again addresses the challenge of improving the world, but now from the perspective of becoming original: choosing to champion novel ideas and values that go against the grain, battle conformity, and buck outdated traditions. How can we originate new ideas, policies, and practices without risking it all? Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders can build cultures that welcome dissent. Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him, and a TV executive who didn't even work in comedy but saved Seinfeld from the cutting-room floor.

The perversion started with the so-called delegates' election. How can I want a free and fair election if I subscribe to the delegates' election where you buy people like chickens and apples and you pay them off? I said let the Lagos people determine through the political party structure who and who they wanted. I created a process to eliminate that delegates' election system and we won. We won the debate and we now have direct primaries in all the local governments. Those who have followed politics here know that it was a tough battle between Funsho Williams of blessed memory and myself. I won 17 local governments out of 20 and in two of them, there were no elections. They chewed the results in my local government, Ikeja. Lagos Mainland was the stronghold of late Funsho Williams and Ikorodu too with Ogunlewe and co.. But we challenged the status quo because it was evident that I won that election no matter whatever story any & shy; body tells you. I still have that record. It is there. Then I was determined to form a government that is profes & shy; sionally and intellectually balanced to be a model for other states.

2016-05-18-089066;"Several days later Murray asked me about a tourist attraction known as the most photographed barn in America. We drove twenty-two miles into the country around Farmington. There were meadows and apple orchards. White fences trailed through the rolling fields. Soon the signs started appearing. THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED BARN IN AMERICA. We counted five signs before we reached the sight... We walked along a cowpath to the slightly elevated spot set aside for viewing and photographing. All the people had cameras; some had tripods, telephoto lenses, filter kits. A man in a booth sold postcards and slides -- pictures of the barn taken from the elevated spot. We stood near a grove of trees and watched the photographers. Murray maintained a prolonged silence, occasionally scrawling some notes in a little book. `No one sees the barn,' he said finally. A long silence followed. `Once you've seen the signs about the barn, it becomes impossible to see the barn.' He fell silent once more. People with cameras left the elevated site, replaced at once by others. `We're not here to capture an image. We're here to maintain one. Can you feel it, Jack? An accumulation of nameless energies.' There was an extended silence. The man in the booth sold postcards and slides. `Being here is a kind of spiritual surrender. We see only what the others see. The thousands who were here in the past, those who will come in the future. We've agreed to be part of a collective perception. This literally colors our vision. A religious experience in a way, like all tourism.' Another silence ensued. `They are taking pictures of taking pictures,' he said.";David Foster Wallace;2016-05-18 14:00:33;1

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart... Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

2016-04-27-008221;Apple suggested the channel inventory reduction would be at least $2.0 billion, which is approximately $1.3 billion greater than we had estimated. This accounts for roughly half of the gap between the high end of the company's revenue guidance of $43.0 billion and our FQ3 revenue estimate heading into the quarter of $45.7 billion. We believe Street estimates, which were above ours, anticipated iPhone demand levels that were simply too high. The remainder of the gap between Apple's guidance and our estimate appears to be spread relatively evenly between iPad, Mac and Apple Watch, with no particularly alarming trends in any of these categories... Additionally, we believe the planned channel inventory reduction almost fully accounts for the weaker-than expected gross-margin guidance. After adjusting units and iPhone product mix in our model, our gross-margin estimate was in line with the high end of Apple's guidance. This suggests the company is not anticipating a material degradation in margins at the product level and, importantly, also suggests that margins can rebound once channel inventory has been normalized.;Aaron Rakers;2016-04-27 11:52:54;1
