# A (not so) Random Walk Down Wall Street
## An investigation into whether media coverage affects the stock price of Apple Inc.

### Abstract
​​Stock prices vary significantly from day to day. Some of these fluctuations are a direct result of events affecting the company. However, media attention and its wordings significantly affect people’s choice to buy or sell a stock, thus affecting the stock price. Our initial idea is to use Quotebank to compare the news coverage of the company Apple Inc., its front figures, and its products to the change in its financial state (stock price, its volatility and sales) between 2015 and 2020. We chose Apple due to its size and their reputation of massive media attention when launching new products. Our goal is to quantify the impact of the media on businesses and the stock market. This could potentially complement how analysts use specific events in the world to explain changes in stock prices.
